# Sayvn ðŸ”Š - "Say Maven" 
Sayvn is a Wrapper for Maven that notifies you via the OSX [`say`](https://ss64.com/osx/say.html) command, whether a task failed or succeeded.

# Why?
Knowing when a Maven build is done is super helpful when there are long running tasks.  This allows you to be notified instead of checking the terminal.

This is a port of [Sam Edwards](https://twitter.com/HandstandSam)' [Saydle](https://github.com/handstandsam/saydle/) wrapper for Gradle.

# System Requirements
* You must be Running Mac OSX

# Installation Instructions
Run the following command from the terminal in the root of your Maven Project (where the `mvnw` file is, if present):
```
curl -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbricon/sayvn/main/sayvnw" && chmod +x sayvnw
```

This will download the [`sayvnw`](https://github.com/fbricon/sayvn/blob/main/sayvnw) file and put it at the root of your Maven project. It then ensures there is permission to execute the file.

# Usage
* Instead of using `./mvnw`, `mvnd` or `mvn` , use `./sayvnw` instead.  That's it!
* Example: `./sayvnw clean verify`

# Advanced Configuration Options
You can edit these options in the `sayvnw` file itself.
* success_phrase="Success"
* failed_phrase="Failed"
* voice="Alex"

# How Does Sayvn ðŸ”Š Work?

Sayvn ðŸ”Š forwards your command to Maven, and then looks at the execution result to say either "Success" or "Failed". 

It will delegate the build execution to:
- `./mvnw`, the Maven Wrapper, if it's found in the current directory,
- `mvnd`, the Maven Daemon, if it's installed and available in the $PATH,
- `mvn`, the Maven Command Line Interface, if it's installed and available in the $PATH.
